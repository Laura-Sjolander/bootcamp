    <h1>What does HTTPS stand for and why should I care?</h1>
  <p>Have you noticed that sometimes it says HTTPS instead of HTTP in the web browser? 
    It looks something <b>like this:</b>
    <img class="https-lock" src="./assets/https-lock.JPG" alt="Image of what a site with https encryption can look like">
    
    The extra <b>S</b> in the URL means that it is a secure way of entering the webpage. This solution is chosen when you need some extra security, 
    for example if you want to enter your credit card number to make purchases online, paying bills or register as a customer or just to login to your library to loan
    some books perhaps. The company would want to secure your personal information while the data is being in transit, 
    so it is encrypted. This can be done eihter with Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
    It is an authentication and security protocol often used in browsers and web servers.
    It means that encrypted data transfers over a secure connection, so data integrity and privacy are maintained
    between a client and a server. It also validates the authentication of websites.
    HTTPS is an abbrevation and stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.</p>
